# n8n-nodes-youtube-transcript

A community node for n8n that allows you to download YouTube video transcripts directly within your n8n workflows.

**Important!** If YouTube blocks your IP address, there's currently no solution I can provide. It may resolve itself over time.
You'll typically see this error:

```bash
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'videoId')
```

This node uses the `youtubei` library to communicate with YouTube's internal API, making it less sensitive to YouTube interface changes.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a workflow automation platform with a [fair-code license](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/).

## Features

- **YouTube Transcript Download**: Extracts transcripts from specified YouTube videos and provides them in text or JSON format for use in your workflows.

  **Important**: Not all YouTube videos have transcripts available.

### Supported URLs

This node supports extracting transcripts from YouTube videos using both `youtube.com/watch?v=example` and `youtu.be/example` URL formats. Simply provide the video URL or ID to your n8n workflow, and the node handles the rest.
